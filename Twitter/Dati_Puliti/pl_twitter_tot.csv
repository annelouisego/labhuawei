1128455856620810240;2019-05-15;as for the why?, i always preferred android over apple, althought i'm not sure which one is better between the galaxy and the huawei, i would go for the galaxy myself;
1128444513863831552;2019-05-14;Yes Android is fragmented but now you're seeing 3 or 4 major players perfecting it. Pixel, OnePlus, Samsung, Huawei. To a lesser extent Xiaomi. Blackberry had a diehard loyalty and also pretty much the entire corporate sector, still got left behind. Apple isn't too big to fail.;
